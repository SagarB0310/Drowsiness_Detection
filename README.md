# Drowsiness_Detection
To build a detection system that identifies key attributes of drowsiness and triggers an alert when someone is drowsy before it is too late.<br> So such a system can be very beneficial to the entire society and for our safety.

Step 1 :– Take image as input from a camera.<br>
Step 2 :– Find the face within the image and make a region of Interest (ROI).<br>

Step 4 :– Model will categorize whether eyes are open or closed.<br>
